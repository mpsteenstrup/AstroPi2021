#AstroPi2021
ESA har opdateret deres to Astro Pi på ISS. Der er kommet en ny PIR sensor til detektion af astronauter, et HQ kamera til jordobservation og machine learning modul. Styresystemet er også opdateret til det nye Rasbian Buster. Det kører også på de gamle Astro Pi og man kan hente billedet på astro.pi hjemmeside. Der er også nye pythonbiblioteker, en oversig kan findes her, [Python biblioteker på ISS](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/code-for-your-astro-pi-mission-space-lab-experiment/2)

## Deltagerbrev fra ESERO
Thank you for registering as a mentor for Mission Space Lab of the 2020/21 European Astro Pi Challenge!

You can register up to five teams for the challenge, and each team can have up to six members.

Each team you register must be eligible for the challenge in order to participate:

* Each team member must be aged 19 or under at the time of this registration
* Each team must have between 2 and 6 members (not including you)
* At least 50% of the team members must be nationals of an ESA Member State, Slovenia, Latvia, Canada, or Malta

What do I need to do next?

You have until **Friday 23 October 2020** to register your team and their experiment idea.

Help your team come up with an experiment idea
As soon as possible, consult with your team to help them choose whether they want to investigate Life on Earth or Life in Space and design their experiment idea. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aac5IUPddOk&t=41s) may help your team come up with their idea.

Your team needs to check whether their idea will work for Mission Space Lab, so it’s very important that they understand the limitations of the Astro Pi hardware on the ISS. The following documents will help them with that:

Rules and hardware limitations for Life on Earth experiments;
[https://astro-pi.org/mission-space-lab/guidelines/life-on-earth](https://astro-pi.org/mission-space-lab/guidelines/life-on-earth)

Rules and hardware limitations for Life in Space experiments;
[https://astro-pi.org/mission-space-lab/guidelines/life-in-space](https://astro-pi.org/mission-space-lab/guidelines/life-in-space)

Register your team's idea
Before you register your team's experiment idea, make sure you read the rules to double-check that their idea is feasible and likely to produce results.

To give your team's experiment idea the best chance of getting through to Phase 2 of Mission Space Lab, you need to cover two key areas when you register:

Describe the experiment idea in good detail
Clearly explain how your team plans to use the hardware

You need to use when registering your team. When you are ready to register your team and their idea, click this link.

You have until Friday 23 October 2020 to register. Once you have registered your team's idea, we will judge it to see whether your team can move on to Phase 2.

If you have any questions about the registration process, or require further assistance, please email us on astropi@esa.int.
